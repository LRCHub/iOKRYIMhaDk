Days were darker then light didn't get through
All this smoke and we had to grope
And luck would be a child with two arms, two feet and a brain to hide a picture
Throw light between your eyes
Go light,
I'll give you one dark love picture

I think of you in light
Think of you in light mess
Think of picture gone pale
Luck would be a child with two arms, two feet and a brain to hide a picture
Go light behind your eyes
Go light,
I'll give you one dark love poem

Days were darker then light didn't get through
All this smoke and we had to grope
And luck would be a child with two arms, two feet and a brain to hide a picture
Throw light between your eyes
Go light,
I'll give you one dark love picture
