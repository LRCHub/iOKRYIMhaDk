I think I'm fishing
Think the big one's coming
I think I'm fishing
Think the big one's coming

I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong

You're the big one
You have milk
You can breathe underwater
Taking me for a ride

I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong

I think I'm fishing
Think the big one's coming
I think I'm fishing
Think the big one's coming
I think I'm fishing
Think the big one's coming

You're the big one
You have milk
You can breathe

Underwater, underwater
Underwater, underwater
Underwater, underwater
Underwater, underwater

I think I'm fishing
Think the big one's coming
I think I'm fishing
Think the big one's coming
I think I'm fishing
Think the big one's coming

I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
I am wrong
