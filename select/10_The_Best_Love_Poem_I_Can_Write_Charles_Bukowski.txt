"Listen," I told her
"Why don't you stick your tongue up my ass?"
"No!" She said
"Well," I said,
"If I stick my tongue up your ass first,
then will you stick your tongue up my ass?"
"Alright," She said
I got my head down there and looked around
Opened a section, then my tongue moved forward
"Not there!" She said, "Hahaha not there! That's not the right place!"
You women have more holes than Swiss cheese
"I don't want you to do it!"
"Why?"
"Well, then I'll have to do it back,
and then at the next party you'll tell
people I licked your ass with my tongue!"
"Suppose, I promise not to tell"
"You'll get drunk, you'll tell"
"Okay," I said
"Roll over, I'll stick it in the other place"
She rolled over, and I stick my tongue in that other place
We were in love
We were in love except with what I said at parties
And we were not in love with each others assholes
She wants me to write a love poem
But I think if people can't love each
other's assholes, and farts, and shits, and
terrible parts
Just like they love the good parts, that ain't complete love
